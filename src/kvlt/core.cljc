(defn websocket!
  "Initiates a websocket connection with the given \"ws:\" or \"wss:\"
  URL and returns a promise resolving to a `core.async` channel.  If a
  connection cannot be established, the promise'll be rejected with an
  `ExceptionInfo` instance.

  Reads and writes on the resulting channel are delegated to distinct
  read/write channels - the \"read\" side being by default an
  unbuffered channel populated with messages from the websocket, and
  the \"write\" side, also unbuffered, being drained into the
  websocket itself.  The `read-chan` and `write-chan` options can be
  specified to e.g. apply a transducer to incoming/outgoing values.

  Closing the returned channel terminates the websocket connection,
  and will close the underlying read & write channels (unless `close?`
  is false, in which event it'll close neither).  The channel will be
  closed (and the same `close?` behaviour applied) if a transport
  error occurs after the connection has been established."

(defn event-source!
  "[Server-sent Events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#server-sent-events) client.

  Initiates a long-lived HTTP connection with `url`, placing maps
  representing incoming events onto a `core.async` channel.

  By default, only events of type `:message` will be considered (per
  spec).  To listen to a set of specific event types, `events` (a set
  of keywords) may be specified.

  The returned channel, when closed, will terminate the underlying SSE
  connection.  By default, the channel is unbuffered - though an
  arbitrary channel can be passed in via `chan` - and will be closed
  when the connection channel closes (or on error), unless `close?` is
  false.  On error, the connection will not be automatically
  re-established.

  `as` is some symbolic value (defaulting to `:string` - no-op) which
  is used as [[kvlt.event-source/format-event]]'s dispatch value.  ```
